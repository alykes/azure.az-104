# Storage Account Overview

Storage Accounts only belong to a single subscription
The storage account name needs to be globally unique
The Storage Account name is also part of the endpoint URL
The Storage Account is deployed to a specifc region
Pricing differeences based on the region it is located in
Put the data in the same region as the application or the users
You need to take note of an governance and compliance requirements

## Creating a Storage Account  

You can a choice of:

- **Standard** - Most scenarios use this type
- **Premium** - more expensive and used for lower latency

**LRS** - Locally redundant storage makes 3 copies of your data in the same region. Non critical scenarios
**ZRS** - Data remains in the same region, geographically distributed and therefore physically distributed. Highly available scenarios
**GRS** - Puts data into a secondary region, therefore you will get 6 copies of your data; 3 in each region. Backup scenarios
**ZGRS** - Combines GRS and ZRS. Recommended for critical data scenarios

If you select GRS and select **Make read access to data available in the event of regional unavailability**, you can use a read only link if the region goes down.

> **Exam Tip:** May ask you what the cheapest option would be for a particular scenario.

There are different types of storage tiers:

Hot - The cheapest
Cool - For data that isn't accessed frequently
Archive - For data backup purposes; set on file by file basis, expensive and takes a long time to retrieve

You pay for reads and writes

## Advanced Options  

There are a few sections here:  

- Security
  - Require secure transfer for REST API - sometimes you might not have an application that doesn't support encryption. I wouldn't recommend turning this off.
  - Enabling public access on containers - So you can allow public access to your container. Again, this isn't recommended.
  - Enable storage account key access - Claims based, more flexible. You can also use Azure Entra ID and RBAC instead of account keys, which is more secure.
  - Minimum TLS version - Should really be set to 1.2. Definitely not recommended to use lower versions.
- Data Lake Storage Gen2
  - Use it for hadoop, Azure Analytics, large data sections.
- Blob Storage
  - **Hot** - The cheapest, day to day usage. The default.
  - **Cool** - For data that isn't accessed frequently, such as backups.
  - Supports up to 5PB
- Azure Files
  - Supports file shares up to a maximum of 100TiB

## Public vs Private Networking

- Enable public access from all networks - By default all storage accounts are accessible on the internet and through all networks within Azure. If you have the storage account keys, then there is an endpoint that you can use to access the data.
- Enable Public Access from selected vnet and public IPs - You can also specify exactly which virtual networks and IP addresses can access the storage account.
- Disable public access and use private access - Finally, you can disable access entirely and use a private endpoint of a private link. You need to set this up on both ends, the storage account and from where you would like to access it.

Network routing can either be through:

- The Microsoft network
- The Public Internet

## Data Protection

- Recovery - Protect data from accidental or erroneous deletion
  - Point in Time restore for containers - it enables, versioning, change feed and blob soft-delete
  - Soft delete - you can retain blobs, containers and files shares for "n" days
- Tracking - Manage versions and keep track of changes made to blob data
  - Enable versioning for blobs
  - Enable blob change feed - keep track of create, modify and delete changes to blobs in the storage account
- Access Control
  - Enable version-level immutability support, basically a file cannot be modified or deleted, good to use for auditing logs
  
## Encryption

Data is encrypted by default. There are two types of encryption:

- **Microsoft Managed Keys (MMK)** - MS handles the keys, this is the default
- **Customer Managed Keys (CMK)** - You handle and manage the keys, usually done for governance and compliance.
  - If you choose CMK, you will have to choose a Keyvault, the encryption key and utilise a Managed Identity.
- **Enable Support for CMK** - Blobs and files only | All service types - **Note:** this setting can't be changed after creation of the storage account.
- **Enable Infrastructure Encryption** - 2nd layer of encryption at the hardware layer
